## Description

This is a project for the course IDG2001 at NTNU Gj√∏vik. The project is a simple file upload and download service. The project is split into two parts, the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a simple web page where you can upload a file and download a file. The backend is a server that handles the file uploads and downloads. The backend is built using Flask and the frontend is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone
cd IDG2001--ASSIGNMENT1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The server should be hosted on railway.app here is my railway link (unsure if there is enough money for it to stay there) https://oblig1-cloud-frontend-production.up.railway.app/

Here is the backend if you want to test api endpoints https://quickest-hair-production.up.railway.app/

## Usage

To use the project you need to run the main.py file. This will start the server and you can access the endpoints through the browser or a tool like Postman. you also need to run backend that#s where the file uploads are sent and processed before you can download the file again. Pls be patient largere files take longer to process.

## Testing

For this project we have used pytest. Run npm install pytest to install pytest. To run the tests, run pytest in the root directory of the project.
